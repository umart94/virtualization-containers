we will use the same bulletin app here as well
since we deployed it on docker, before deploying to kubernetes cluster in
swarm mode, we have to stop AND THEN DELETE THE DOCKER CONTAINER FOR BULLETIN BOARD.


now , to actually run the application in kubernetes we have two ways

1. Kubernetes
2. Docker SWARM

we also need to configure orchestration.
