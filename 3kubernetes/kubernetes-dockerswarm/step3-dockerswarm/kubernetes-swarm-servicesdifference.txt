Kubernetes Services and Swarm Services are very different! Despite the similar name, the two orchestrators mean very different things by the term ‘service’. In Swarm, a service provides both scheduling and networking facilities, creating containers and providing tools for routing traffic to them. In Kubernetes, scheduling and networking are handled separately: deployments (or other controllers) handle the scheduling of containers as pods, while services are responsible only for adding networking features to those pods.
