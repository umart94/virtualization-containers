Set your distribution version to WSL 1 or WSL 2
You can check the WSL version assigned to each of the Linux distributions you have installed by opening the PowerShell command line and entering the command (only available in Windows Build 18362 or higher): wsl -l -v

PowerShell

Copy
wsl --list --verbose


Now Run 

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --list --verbose
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* docker-desktop         Stopped         2
  docker-desktop-data    Stopped         2
  Ubuntu                 Running         2



To set a distribution to be backed by either version of WSL please run:

PowerShell

Copy
wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>


Make sure to replace <distribution name> with the actual name of your distribution and <versionNumber> with the number '1' or '2'. You can change back to WSL 1 at anytime by running the same command as above but replacing the '2' with a '1'.

Additionally, if you want to make WSL 2 your default architecture you can do so with this command:

PowerShell

Copy
wsl --set-default-version 2


This will set the version of any new distribution installed to WSL 2.
