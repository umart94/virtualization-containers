Prerequisites
Before you install the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend, you must complete the following steps:

Install Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.
Enable WSL 2 feature on Windows. For detailed instructions, refer to the Microsoft documentation.
Download and install the Linux kernel update package.


Enter this command in the command line you've opened in Admin mode: wsl.exe --install
Restart your machine

docker desktop shows 
You don't have any WSL 2 distro. Please convert a WSL 1 distro to WSL 2, or install a new distro and it will appear here.


now the command has changed
also, we need to set only a default distribution here, wsl is installed properly.


we need to run this command : 

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform 

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform


Path          :
Online        : True
RestartNeeded : False


we still cannot run this command

we have to be inside windows insiders program


so , now we will install wsl manually.

Manual Installation Steps
If you are not on a Windows Insiders build, the features required for WSL will need to be enabled manually following the steps below.




Step 1 - Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux
You must first enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature before installing any Linux distributions on Windows.

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

PowerShell

Copy
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart





dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.19041.572

Image Version: 10.0.19041.572

Enabling feature(s)
[==========================100.0%==========================]
The operation completed successfully.


We recommend now moving on to step #2, updating to WSL 2, but if you wish to only install WSL 1, you can now restart your machine and move on to Step 6 - Install your Linux distribution of choice. To update to WSL 2, wait to restart your machine and move on to the next step.


10.0.19041 Build 19041


Step 2 - Update to WSL 2
To update to WSL 2, you must be running Windows 10.

Requirements
For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.
Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2. Use the Windows Update Assistant to update your version of Windows.


To check your version and build number, select Windows logo key + R, type winver, select OK. (Or enter the ver command in Windows Command Prompt). Update to the latest Windows version in the Settings menu.

 Note

If you are running Windows 10 version 1903 or 1909, open "Settings" from your Windows menu, navigate to "Update & Security" and select "Check for Updates". Your Build number must be 18362.1049+ or 18363.1049+, with the minor build # over .1049. Read more: WSL 2 Support is coming to Windows 10 Versions 1903 and 1909. See the troubleshooting instructions.


Step 3 - Enable Virtual Machine feature
Before installing WSL 2, you must enable the Virtual Machine Platform optional feature.

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.19041.572

Image Version: 10.0.19041.572

Enabling feature(s)
[==========================100.0%==========================]
The operation completed successfully.



Restart your machine to complete the WSL install and update to WSL 2.

Step 4 - Download the Linux kernel update package
Download the latest package:

WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines

If you're using an ARM64 machine, please download the ARM64 package instead. If you're not sure what kind of machine you have, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter: systeminfo | find "System Type".


Run the update package downloaded in the previous step. (Double-click to run - you will be prompted for elevated permissions, select ‘yes’ to approve this installation.)

Once the installation is complete, move on to the next step - setting WSL 2 as your default version when installing new Linux distributions. (Skip this step if you want your new Linux installs to be set to WSL 1).



my windows 10 pro build is : 10.0.19041 Build 19041

 wsl --set-default-version 2
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2


 Note

The update from WSL 1 to WSL 2 may take several minutes to complete depending on the size of your targeted distribution. If you are running an older (legacy) installation of WSL 1 from Windows 10 Anniversary Update or Creators Update, you may encounter an update error. Follow these instructions to uninstall and remove any legacy distributions.

If wsl --set-default-version results as an invalid command, enter wsl --help. If the --set-default-version is not listed, it means that your OS doesn't support it and you need to update to version 1903, Build 18362 or higher.

If you see this message after running the command: WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. For information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel. You still need to install the MSI Linux kernel update package.


ubuntu 20.04 lts update


The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for a minute or two for files to de-compress and be stored on your PC. All future launches should take less than a second.

You will then need to create a user account and password for your new Linux distribution.


also install windows terminal from microsoft store.


now we can launch a ubuntu distribution that is installed natively on windows.
