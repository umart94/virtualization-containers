open docker
From the Docker menu, select Settings > General.
Select the Use WSL 2 based engine check box.

If you have installed Docker Desktop on a system that supports WSL 2, this option will be enabled by default.


Click Apply & Restart.
Ensure the distribution runs in WSL 2 mode. WSL can run distributions in both v1 or v2 mode.

To check the WSL mode, run:

wsl.exe -l -v

To upgrade your existing Linux distro to v2, run:

wsl.exe --set-version (distro name) 2

To set v2 as the default version for future installations, run:

wsl.exe --set-default-version 2

When Docker Desktop restarts, go to Settings > Resources > WSL Integration.

WSL Integration will be enabled on your default WSL distribution. To change your default WSL distro, run wsl --set-default <distro name>.

For example, to set Ubuntu as your default WSL distro, run wsl --set-default ubuntu.

Optionally, select any additional distributions you would like to enable WSL 2 on.
