Open a command-line terminal like PowerShell, and try out some Docker commands

Run docker version to check the version.


docker --version

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Docker is available in any terminal as long as the Docker Desktop for Windows app is running. Settings are available on the UI, accessible from the Docker whale in the taskbar.
