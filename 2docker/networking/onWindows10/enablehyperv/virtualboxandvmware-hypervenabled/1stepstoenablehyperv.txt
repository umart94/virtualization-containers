uninstall vmware
uninstall virtualbox

go to control panel

turn on each and every hyperv option

now check that hyperv is running by using services.msc

You can check if the services are running:

Win+R -> services.msc Look in the list for all services beginning with Hyper-V. If any of them are Running, it's on. (Specifically, the core of it I believe is labelled Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management)

You can check the system log to see if any activity has occurred guide here:

Open Event Viewer. Click Start, click Administrative Tools, and then click Event Viewer.

Open the Hyper-V-Hypervisor event log. In the navigation pane, expand Applications and Services Logs, expand Microsoft, expand Hyper-V-Hypervisor, and then click Operational.

If Windows hypervisor is running, no further action is needed. If Windows hypervisor is not running, perform the following steps.

Open the System log. (In the navigation pane, expand Windows Logs and then select System.)

Look for events from Hyper-V-Hypervisor for more information. For example, event ID 41 indicates a problem with the BIOS configuration: “Hyper-V launch failed; Either VMX not present or not enabled in BIOS.” (To filter for these events, from the Actions pane, click Filter Current Log, and then for Event sources, specify “Hyper-V-Hypervisor”.)
