Docker, Containers use a seperate technology called HyperV

it is a native hypervisor running inside the HOST operating system,

it emulates THE HOST OPERATING SYSTEM (PORTIONS OF IT) , so we have :

1. Host Hardware
2. Host Operating System, Running Native Hypervisor HyperV
3. Docker software, installed in Microsoft Windows , PaaS, all containers are run by the single operating system kernel, running the hyperV as well as docker

THUS, in this way , we dont have to have seperate operating systems and virtual machines, we use less resources.

4. Web Application Project Running in Container in Docker.
