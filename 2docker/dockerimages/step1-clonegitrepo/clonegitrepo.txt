Run docker image ls to list the hello-world image that you downloaded to your machine.

List the hello-world container (spawned by the image) which exits after displaying its message. If it is still running, you do not need the --all option:

docker ps --all



Let us download the node-bulletin-board example project. This is a simple bulletin board application written in Node.js.



If you are using Git, you can clone the example project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/node-bulletin-board
cd node-bulletin-board/bulletin-board-app

Define a container with Dockerfile
After downloading the project, take a look at the file called Dockerfile in the bulletin board application. Dockerfiles describe how to assemble a private filesystem for a container, and can also contain some metadata describing how to run a container based on this image.

For more information about the Dockerfile used in the bulletin board application, see Sample Dockerfile.
