Introduction
Now that you’ve set up your development environment, you can begin to develop containerized applications. In general, the development workflow looks like this:

Create and test individual containers for each component of your application by first creating Docker images.

Assemble your containers and supporting infrastructure into a complete application.

Test, share, and deploy your complete containerized application.

In this stage of the tutorial, let’s focus on step 1 of this workflow: creating the images that your containers will be based on. Remember, a Docker image captures the private filesystem that your containerized processes will run in; you need to create an image that contains just what your application needs to run.
